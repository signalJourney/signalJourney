# Contributing to Signal Journey

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Signal Journey specification and its associated tools!

We welcome contributions in various forms, from reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements to improving documentation and adding examples.

## Getting Started

*   **Code of Conduct:** Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to adhere to its principles.
*   **License:** By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [BSD 3-Clause License (`LICENSE`)](LICENSE).
*   **Issues:** Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuromechanist/signalJourney/issues) for existing bug reports or feature requests.

## Development Setup

To contribute code changes, you'll need a local development environment:

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.
2.  **Environment:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
    ```bash
    # Using venv
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    
    # Using conda
    # conda create -n signaljourney python=3.10
    # conda activate signaljourney
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the core library and development dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev,test,docs]
    ```
    This installs the `signaljourney_validator` package in editable mode (`-e`) along with all optional dependencies required for testing, linting, and building documentation.

## Making Changes

1.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-validation-error`).
2.  **Code:** Make your code changes.
3.  **Linting:** Ensure your code adheres to the style guide by running `ruff`:
    ```bash
    ruff check . && ruff format .
    ```
4.  **Testing:** Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes in the `tests/` directory. Run the full test suite with `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    Ensure all tests pass and aim for good test coverage.
5.  **Documentation:** If your changes affect the specification, validator behavior, or user-facing features, update the documentation in the `docs/` directory. You can preview the documentation locally:
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
6.  **Commit:** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
7.  **Push:** Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
8.  **Pull Request:** Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the `neuromechanist/signalJourney` repository.
    *   Clearly describe the purpose and details of your changes in the PR description.
    *   Link to any relevant GitHub issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Reporting Bugs

*   Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuromechanist/signalJourney/issues) page.
*   Provide a clear title and description.
*   Include steps to reproduce the bug.
*   Mention the version of `signaljourney_validator` you are using.
*   If possible, include a minimal example `signalJourney.json` file that triggers the bug.

## Suggesting Enhancements

*   Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuromechanist/signalJourney/issues) page.
*   Provide a clear title and detailed description of the proposed enhancement and its motivation.
*   Explain the use case and potential benefits.

## Proposing Schema Changes / New Namespaces

The Signal Journey specification uses namespaces under the `extensions` property to allow for domain-specific information. Major changes to the core schema or proposals for new top-level namespaces require careful consideration.

1.  **Discussion First:** Please open a GitHub issue with the label `schema-proposal` or `namespace-proposal` to initiate a discussion *before* creating a pull request for schema changes.
2.  **Justification:** Clearly outline the need, scope, and potential structure.
3.  **Review Process:** Follow the discussion and review process guided by the maintainers.
