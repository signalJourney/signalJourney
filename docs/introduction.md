# Introduction to Signal Journey

Signal Journey is a specification for creating machine-readable descriptions of biosignal processing pipelines. Its primary goal is to enhance the **reproducibility**, **transparency**, and **interoperability** of complex data analysis workflows commonly found in fields like neuroscience, electrophysiology, and biomedical engineering.

## The Problem

Modern biosignal analysis involves numerous steps, diverse software tools (MATLAB, Python, EEGLAB, MNE-Python, etc.), and complex parameter settings. Documenting these pipelines accurately is often challenging, relying on:

* Handwritten notes in lab notebooks.
* Comments within analysis scripts.
* Separate manuscript methods sections.

These methods are prone to errors, omissions, and inconsistencies, making it difficult for researchers to:

* Understand precisely how data was processed.
* Reproduce the results reliably.
* Compare results across different studies or labs.
* Re-apply or adapt pipelines to new datasets.

## The Solution: Signal Journey Files

Signal Journey addresses these challenges by defining a standardized **JSON format** (`*_signalJourney.json`) to capture the essential details of a processing pipeline. A Signal Journey file describes:

* **Pipeline Information:** Name, version, description.
* **Input Data:** Origin and type of the raw data.
* **Processing Steps:** A detailed sequence of analysis steps, including:
  * Software used (name, version).
  * Function or command executed.
  * Parameters and their values.
  * Inputs and outputs of each step.
  * Dependencies between steps.
* **Output Data:** Description of the final processed data products.
* **Schema Versioning:** Ensures compatibility and understanding over time.

## Key Benefits

* **Standardization:** Provides a common language for describing pipelines.
* **Machine Readability:** Allows automated validation, parsing, and potentially visualization or re-execution of pipelines.
* **Reproducibility:** Captures the critical details needed to replicate an analysis.
* **Transparency:** Makes the entire workflow explicit and understandable.
* **Interoperability:** Facilitates sharing and comparison of methods across different tools and platforms.
